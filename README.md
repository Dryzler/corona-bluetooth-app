- The project is currently **on hold**. The accuracy of normal Bluetooth device detection is too imprecise. For example, I recognize other devices / people walking outside past on the street 10 meters away. I will continue to follow the projects of [Google and Apple](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220644/apple-googles-bluetooth-low-energy-le-coronavirus-tracking-contact-tracing) as well as [pepp-pt](https://www.pepp-pt.org/) and will possibly continue to work in this solution here.
